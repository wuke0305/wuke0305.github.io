I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Photonics Center at Boston University, where I earned my Ph.D. degree in 2023. Prior to this, I obtained my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Tsinghua University in 2016 and Chongqing University in 2013, respectively. 

My research focuses on developing metamaterials to manipulate and edit electric and magnetic fields in both temporal and spatial dimensions. I explore methodologies that integrate metamaterials, electronics, sensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), algorithm-driven reconfigurable structures to engineer human-centered, mechanically-adaptive functional devices and systems that interact seamlessly with the human body, advancing healthcare technologies including clinical MRI, wireless powering, and wearable sensing.


I have served as the first and co-first author on publications in prestigious journals, including _Science Advances_, _Nature Communications_, _Advanced Materials_, _Advanced Science_, _Microsystem & Nanoengineering_. My research has received widespread recognition, with coverage in over 100 media outlets such as _Science Daily_, _Medical Republic_, _Healthcare-in-Europe_, _Medhealth Outlook_, _Physics World_, and _Phys.org_.
